# RiseOfMitra
Rise of Mitra is a turn-based board game with a discrete world.

# History
Rise of Mitra tells the history of a battle for resources between two races in the small planet Mitra. The planet is the only place in galaxy where Argyros Crystal grows. A small piece of it has an almost infinity energy that can be used to sustain a large city for many centuries. The planet is inhabited by two races: Rakhars and Dalrions. The Rakhars are a technological race, they are half organic and  mechanical species that have a knowledge superior than that the Dalrions. Whereas the Dalrions are a more archaic culture, venerating the old gods and realizing sacrifices in their names. Both of them have their interests on Argyros, and they have been in war since ancient times for the control of this resource.
